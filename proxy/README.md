## Proxy

## Proxy Transports

We need C2S and P2P actually. 

With Client2Server based its simpler and we can hide the Server behind Tor as an onion.

With P2P, we can also use Tor

All of them ensure no data persists on the device IF we want, Or a cache be be on the devices.


## Application 

We are building the equivalent of Gsuite to provide an alternative, so that users are not sharing their data with Google
Tor want it: https://support.torproject.org/tormessenger/

The data is stored on:

1. Device or
2. On ours Servers or
3. The Users home Rasp PI Server. Which is an exact copy of our Servers and multi-tenanted so that a User can share another friends Raspberry PI
