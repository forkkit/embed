# tor proxy

Allows a multi hop way to connect and hide your IP via the many hops you jump through an exit to the public internet

Runs locally on 127.0.0.1:9150 as a socks proxy

UDP is NOT supported.

## Domain Fronting
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake

Domain fronting only used for brief Signalling / NAT-piercing to setup P2P webrtc which handles the actual traffic.

Which is EXACTLY what we run now for WebRTC TURN and STUN.

How it works:

1. Volunteers visit websites which host the "snowflake" proxy. 
2. Tor clients automatically find available browser proxies over the
domain fronted signaling channel.
3. Tor client and Proxy proxy establish a WebRTC peer connection.
4. Proxy connects to some relay.
5. Tor occurs.

All the things here WE should have for GetCourageNow !

We are telling everyone we run Tor and also asking for coders. This is a good combo because they know we are serious.
