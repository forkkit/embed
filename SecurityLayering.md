- Moved Holding company to US now :(

	3rd Thurday meeting



## Threat Models

- Its generic and can be from:

Properties typically are:

- Social Structure
	- Gas Lighting cyber warefare, etc
	- Social Hacking

- You know the users IP.
- Can go down and not end of the world

b. Strongest

- If broken into is life threatening
- If goes down is life threatening

# Onboaridng across level example

Hardest if onboaridng / key exchange

# cipher

One time crypto pad
- used by security services
- provable.
- serversgenerating randomness
- just agree on time ( shared ) and shard key.

NEED Random number generator o fhgh quality
- How to test 
- Noise from a zdiode. ( its a real physic diode )



# Phscial Secuirty 

- faraday box where all parties put all mobiles etc into the box to have a meeting
	- portable


- Mifi, so you separate the User device form the comms device.
	- Adguard DNS Proxy runnng onthe MIFI
	- Tablet is the device with your keys.

TheThin listeing device
- Built in 1930's 

# Security training

- best practice procedure.
	- airpot ( phone off )




## Approaches

Vertical Islanda
- 

1. Allowing users to have Rights that is based on security hardening

2. Horizontal islands

- Resiliency
