# Discovery

For:

- Server endpoints

- Client to be signed up.



We need a way for clients to do the initial signup not using HTTPS.

The problem is that they use a HTTPS Endpoint to sign up.
- so they lost their anon.
- but it makes it way easier for us to get blocked.

HTTPS DNS is useless still.



Mechanisms:

Everyone VPN
- that anyone can connect to.
- Just for the onboarding into the closed VPN.
- Put the keys to the open VPN into the code obfuscated.

Blockchain
- for VPN endpoints to be kept up to date for clients

Bluetooth
- for users to onboard a local user with the endpoints.
